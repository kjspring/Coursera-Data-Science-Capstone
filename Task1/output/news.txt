"RB Brandon Jacobs. At the tail end of a 10-yard catch-and-run, he was standing on the sideline as three Pats who failed to bring him down were lying on top of one another. It reminded me of a game against the Buccaneers in 2006 — Jacobs’ second season — when he left six Buccaneers on the ground as he stood on the sideline and let out (forgive this homerish-sounding phrase but it’s the best way to describe it) a mighty roar.

Plus, he slowed down Carter’s rush on the game-winning touchdown."

Then the Thunder beat the Lakers on a pick-and-roll that resulted in Westbrook getting an open dunk en route to a 84-70 lead with 9:08 remaining. The boos continued when Kevin Durant posterized Gasol in the third quarter. That play epitomized everything the Lakers lacked defensively. The Thunder converted on 23 second-chance points and outrebounded them, 48-44 , because of the Lakers' inconsistency in boxing out. OKC even beat the Lakers in the half-court because of their tendency in playing underneath the screens. The Lakers may wonder why the media has been skeptical of their progress this season. Hogwash. Their performance against Oklahoma City explained why."

Jerry Seps is a master of Zin nuance, as this latest example shows. Or look for the 2009 Bucklin Bambino Old Hill Ranch Sonoma Valley Zinfandel ($24, 15.2%), a young-vines effort from one of Sonoma's oldest vineyard sites. It's not only an homage to proper field blends (Petite Sirah, Alicante Bouschet and more appear), but it also offers that perfect mix of bramble fruit and dark pepper spice, with raspberry jam and bay leaf tones.

But that success comes with a key caveat — identifying money the city is owed is not nearly the same thing as collecting it, and that process is difficult. For starters, the city isn't the one that administers the homestead tax credit program.

That said, there were no sacred cows — her murders were as socially diverse as her victims, and Poirot's greatest asset was that, as a foreigner, no one thought him important enough to guard against. Through him and his less-than-perceptive British foil, Hastings, Christie was able to dissect the famous British reserve and rigid dictates of class. The running joke that no one seemed capable of believing that, although he spoke French, Poirot was in fact Belgian, served as a perpetual admonishment against Britain's often dismissive relationship with its European neighbors."

Maryland has the \"all payer system,\" whereby the cost of uncompensated care is borne by all payers to a given hospital through higher rates for insured patients at the same institution. In the rest of the country, charity hospitals providing uncompensated care are mostly reimbursed by Medicare. We argue that eligibility for hospital care provided without billing the patient be limited to those with incomes above Medicaid eligibility levels up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level (between $28,000 and $66,000 for a family of four, for example). Further subsidies could be provided by progressive county or state governments in the form of tax credits or the like."

"Benjamin has been a big-play threat for the Hurricanes over the years. Initially an electric return specialist only, he eventually became an effective pass-catching option. He is undersized but shows speed to get past safeties, and the route-running savvy to outwork corners and separate from them to make plays on the ball. He will be somewhat limited in his transition to the NFL due to his size, but there are many receivers of his stature that have shown the ability to overcome this at the next level.

"(On building a foundation in the draft and how much he has held back on free agency and trades so far and when they will delve more heavily into that)- \"At the end of the season that kind of develops its own life. This year as I mentioned we're focused in on handling our own guys, key guys, Joe Thomas and guys like that. I know that's the way we're going to do it. What you've said, you build a foundation and I think stability for your franchise through the draft. I believe in that. After every offseason how you dive into free agency is determined, one, by whose available and, two, your needs, your immediate needs. Of course there's a money element to that as well. There have not been any constrictions about money, so then it's just decision making. It's been my experience and I think probably Tom's as well, is that I think maybe we signed maybe the greatest free agent of all-time in Reggie White, the greatest free agent of all-time in Reggie White in Green Bay. At the time we paid him more money than anyone thought you should pay anybody. Now, looking back on it, it seems like beer money. You've also seen and you've also reported on and you've also read about free agents that just go, 'My goodness,' it didn't work. You're really rolling the dice a little bit. The grass always looks greener. That player always looks better than the player you have. You've got to be real careful with that. I think our philosophy will be, build through the draft, evaluate our needs and if there's a man available we'll go after him. We'll be as competitive in free agency as anybody. Are we just going to go off the charts every offseason doing that? No, I suspect that it will be different each year based on our needs.\""

"What are some common mistakes you've noticed in amateur runners? What I'm observing now is a lot of people are running the longer distances far too soon, and they're not prepared for them. People think the 10K is not sexy anymore, so everyone thinks they have to run a half-marathon or marathon. I watch so many people looking miserable out there, and we lose a lot of people to the sport because they're not prepared.

"The facts are never going to change. A white police officer shot an unarmed black man in the back with a rifle. It does not matter whether the officer believed he was at risk, or whether he believed that fellow officers or innocent people could be in danger. No black mother can read about this case without worrying that her son could be the next victim. It does not matter whether she is rich or poor, or whether her son is a doctor or a high school dropout. She knows the odds are against her son simply because he is a black man. It's a knee-jerk reflex for a black mother. I doubt that any white mother in Portland can recall reading a newspaper story about a black police officer shooting an unarmed young white man in the back."

"Miami back Lamar Miller's 54-yard run on the Hurricanes' first offensive play illustrated the problem. The Miami offensive line blew open a hole, linebackers Storm Klein and Andrew Sweat couldn't get off their blocks, and then linebacker Etienne Sabino and safeties Orhian Johnson and C.J. Barnett all whiffed on Miller, basically taking one another out of the play in a three-way, missed-tackle collision. Both Simon and Sweat have talked about a miscommunication on the play, with Simon indicating some part of the defense didn't hear an adjustment. But Haynes didn't buy that."

"Now what the Browns are saying by drafting Weeden and not significantly adding to the receiving corps in the draft (after ignoring the position in free agency) is that Colt McCoy was part of the problem. That despite all the drops and the other issues specific to the individual wide receivers that McCoy's lack of zip and accuracy held back the offense."
"\"I see this as a continuation of the first two years,\" Christie said at a Statehouse news conference, where he was flanked by a small army of staffers. \"So many of the players are the same or similar.

"The first step in curbing the nagging cycle, experts say, is to admit that you are stuck in a bad pattern. You are fighting about fighting.

"* One more thing: some will say that the Cardinals, in their dealings with Pujols, should have taken the approach that the Reds' used with Votto. Sorry, not the same. Not even close. The Votto deal happened because of the Pujols/Fielder contracts. Pujols and Fielder re-set the template for contracts given to proven power-hitting first basemen. The Pujols-Fielder deals dramatically changed the market. Without Pujols and Fielder shaking up the paradigm, the Reds wouldn't have been anything near 10 years, $225 million for Votto. Some will say: well what about Philadelphia giving Ryan Howard five years at $25 million a year two seasons ago? The Cardinals should have made their move then, right? That's simplistic for this reason: Pujols would have never under any circumstances accepted a five-year deal, even if it beat Howard's AAV by a wide margin. Not a chance. The starting point for Team Pujols was the Alex Rodriguez deal, 10 years for $275 million. There was zero chance of the Cardinals giving Pujols that kind of deal in advance."

If the Packers franchise Flynn with the intent of trading him, the price tag could be a No. 2 pick, or higher, plus the $50 million or so it would take to tie up Flynn to a long-term contract.

"There's an inviolable law of animated films - the more \"names\" you have in the voice cast, the weaker you know your film is. Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace & Gromit cartoons and the hit \"Chicken Run,\" tip their hand that way with \"The Pirates! Band of Misfits.\"A pirate picture that's entirely too late to the party to have much in the line of fresh pirate gags, it is stuffed with name voice actors, from Hugh Grant as The Pirate Captain to Salma Hayek, Brendan Gleeson, Imelda Stanton, Anton Yelchin and Jeremy Piven. And all of them sat in a recording booth and struggled to find funny things to say or funny ways to say the not-so-funny things in the script. Amusing in small doses, \"Pirates\" is the first Aardman film to suffer a serious shortage of sight gags, the first where the whimsy feels forced and the strain shows. Hugh Grant's Pirate Captain (that's his name) is all Hugh Grant stutter and \"glittering eyes and glorious beard.\" As a pirate, he's something of a bust, even though his crew adores him. He figures he's due for the \"Pirate of the Year\" award. But he's always come up short in the booty and pillaging department. There's always a Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek), Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry) or Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) to beat him to the podium. And so it appears it will be in the 1837 awards, until he captures Charles Darwin (David Tennant), a scientist who craves fame as much as The Pirate Captain. And Darwin recognizes the Captain's pet \"parrot,\" Polly, as something altogether more amazing. She's the last Dodo bird. Darwin talks The Pirate Captain into sailing to Britain, under the nose of pirate-hating Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton), where Darwin hopes to present the bird to The Royal Society, whose entryway is marked \"Playing God since 1807.\" So you've got pirates roughly 120 years after their heyday, and a scheming Darwin paired with his evolved chimp pal, a \"Man Pan Zee,\" he calls him. You've got other scientists, hoping to win acclaim with everything from airships to a Rubik's Cube. You have competing pirates, all swagger and swordplay. What you don't have is a lot of laughs. Only in 2-D after tonight. (PG, 88 minutes)"

In the quantum world, however, certain phenomena have arisen known as retro causation, and exactly as it sounds, a future measurement appears as if it is affecting a past event. This would be a form of entanglement that reaches backward in time, a new form of spookiness."

The 2012 race organizers, despite the popularity of last year's event with drivers and fans alike, have yet to line up a title sponsor either. In its get-tough act with the new race promoters after last year's debacle, the city insisted on a series of deadlines and benchmarks, but they have not been met."

If viewers can look at the shapes, colors, texture and not worry about \"what it is\" or what they are supposed to see or think, they'll be fine. I like the analogy of music as well. We don't try to explain what a guitar riff is, but we can react to the sound. Viewers should react to what they see, which means they really need to look. What did the artist do? What does it make the viewer feel? What does it remind them of? If the work had a sound, what would it be? I like to relate looking at work to how it feels in the body, or physical experiences in the world."

"\"That's obviously a heck of an accomplishment when you think there are 345 Division I teams,\" Matta said Tuesday, referencing the three-year run the Buckeyes share with the Wildcats, who knocked them from the tournament last season. \"Being in this situation is great, but being complacent or satisfied is something that we don't want to do.\""

During the epic embarrassment of the March news conference about the cover-up, Gee joked that he worried Tressel would fire him, not the other way around."

"Artsies in Portland seldom utter the word \"gallery\" without preceding it with \"commercial\"—reminiscent of the way people in Southern California used to say \"snow skiing.\" Portland's art galleries—at least the ones I sampled in the Pearl District—have more of a goods-for-sale vibe than the feeling of standing up for particular aesthetics. In size and plain-white-cubeness, the Elizabeth Leach Gallery most closely resembles a serious New York or Los Angeles gallery. Charles A. Hartman Fine Art and PDX Contemporary Art, both recommended to me as standard-bearers, offered fairly conservative painting (respectively, Eva Speer's realist chunks of ocean garnished at the edges with \"unfinished\" skeins of combed paint, and the twee veggies of Tina Beebe's \"Of Gardens\" exhibition). Both shows were quite respectable but hardly as weirdly compelling as Ralph Pugay's wickedly faux-naive little pictures (one title, \"Chicken Pox Orgy,\" should convey the flavor) at a funky place on the north side called Rocksbox—which is, naturally enough, yet another alternative space."

"1. Motivation. The Lakers may have adopted a grinding mentality under Coach Mike Brown. But they've still shown that external circumstances drive them. Whether it's locker-room drama or responding to teams they don't like, the Lakers have and always will thrive on conflict. In this case, the Lakers are still stewing over Dallas sweeping them in the 2011 Western Conference semifinals. That's why the Lakers hardly feel easy about the Mavericks, despite sweeping them 4-0 in the regular season. Should Dallas and the Lakers meet in the first round, there's no way the Lakers would allow any games to slip out of their reach because of a lack of focus. For better or worse, the Lakers' actual effort largely dictates results. In this case, it would be a good thing."

This simple change could help restore civility to our politics, perhaps creating room for bipartisan solutions to our country's great problems, and revive faith in the American political system."

"There are a few things Minnesotans need to know about the companies that are asking the legislature and governor to let them mine sulfide metals from the edges of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Glencore, which wants to mine in a wetland in the Lake Superior watershed near Hoyt Lakes, has brought aboard Tony Hayward as their \"Executive expert in charge of environment and safety\" Why does the name Tony Hayward ring a bell? He is the former BP executive who was at the helm when the BP oil spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. He famously told reporters after the spill that he, \"Wanted to get his life back.\" Apparently overseeing mining in Minnesota is part of this plan. And another major project, the Twin Metals mine that would be located a few miles from the BWCAW, has recently retained URS Consulting to do their environmental impact study. URS is the company that was in charge of inspecting both the 35W bridge and the Sabo pedestrian bridge when they each collapsed.

"Just about all of Southern California's sleepy little beach towns have been built up, priced up and, by many measures, messed up. But San Clemente's pier, beaches and red-tile roofs endure, and they're worth a look. The waves here offer some of North America's best surfing, including the spot known as Trestles (just south of town within San Onofre State Beach), which some people call \"the Yosemite of surfing.\" San Clemente also has an Amtrak stop right by the pier — which raises the tempting idea of a carless beach weekend — and don't forget the beachside pedestrian path that leads north from the pier to a great playground at Linda Lane Park."

Athletes are taught to exploit a foe's weakness  a sore shoulder, a bad hand, a loss of foot speed.

"Thanks to the diligence of so many students, scientists, clinicians and public supporters of free and open access to research, FRPAA has been reintroduced, and the RWA has been thwarted, at least for now. These proponents of open access refused to accept that in this digital age, clinicians should be so removed from the data providing the foundation for evidence-based practice. FRPAA will grant clinicians like my mother the ability to use this information that is so crucial for the appropriate treatment of their patients. Our voice has been heard, but the fight rages on. FRPAA has to traverse the harrowing political environment of the House and Senate to succeed. We must use our voices and our votes to support free and open access to publicly funded research, and thereby improve the health care provided to the American people."
"In frequent letters to his family and friends, Holm pondered the nature of God and man and the absurdities of prison life.

I wanted to do this one in an intimate way, because I think the concept is intimate. They know about my life and the ELP years and all of this. What they really enjoy, I think, is hearing other people in the audience talk about their experiences with the music."

William Mapother—he made a relatively small role memorable in \"In the Bedroom\"—is John Burroughs, a composer whose life has been devastated by something dreadful and presumably irreversible. Does this sound dreadfully formulaic? It is, but it also isn't, because the actors and their director invest almost every moment with spellbinding urgency, even when Rhoda and John are having spontaneous fun—a lively interlude turns on video boxing—or starting to light up each others' lives."

I grew up thinking it was table wine. Later, when I was in college and my roommates and I decided to throw a party we wanted to serve Veuve Clicquot. I went to the store and put six bottles on the counter. The clerk told me the price, so I went to pay. Then he told me that it was the price for just one bottle. I couldn't believe it. My mother, realizing I couldn't afford it, sent me a check the next day. It was the best party I ever threw."

Pigs were often used to help root out fields, allowed to forage in the forest, fed scraps from the table and skim milk or whey from the cow and eventually became juicy bacon for the table. However, when we had the bright idea to mass produce pork, pigs weren't well suited for the task, so specific breeding developed pigs that were at least more tolerant of living in uncomfortable, cramped quarters."

"The phrase—battling everything—could have been the mantra for Game of Thrones’ second season on screen and off. Based on New Mexico novelist George R.R. Martin’s fantasy-book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones follows the brutal quest for power among several ruling families in a sprawling mythical kingdom. Its initial 10-episode series order was considered a risky move for a premium network best known for contemporary shows like The Sopranos and Sex and the City. Though the sexy vampire drama True Blood proved that a supernatural series could succeed on the network, the high-fantasy genre was still considered so...so...nerdy. Television’s last hit fantasy series was the syndicated Xena: Warrior Princess, and no TV show had ever pulled off combining swords, sorcery, and R-rated sex and violence. When Thrones premiered to lavish critical praise last April, the network granted it a quick renewal. “Our biggest goal is passionate engagement,” says HBO programming chief Michael Lombardo. “And Thrones has rabidly passionate viewers.” But only about 2.2 million people tuned in for the initial airing, which isn’t so hot when a network spends a reported $50–60 million on a project. Then something strange happened. Fueled by word-of-mouth buzz, Thrones’ ratings went up. And up. Martin’s novels leaped onto best-seller lists, moving a staggering 8.4 million copies in 2011, including his newest Song of Ice and Fire installment, A Dance With Dragons."

"\"Bully\" has been in the news a lot lately because it received a restrictive R rating (for a small amount of bad language) and then chose to go into theaters unrated. Its distributor, Weinstein Co., made that choice because the film's subject matter, the pervasiveness of school-related bullying and what can be done about it, would seem to cry out for a high school age and younger audience. And \"Bully\" has an emotional impact that must be viewed to be understood."

"The good news is that prosecutors and policymakers in some parts of Florida have had success shutting these operations down. In Central Florida, prosecutors have shut them down in Orange and Osceola Counties, successfully arguing that they are unlawful gambling establishments. A recent federal court ruling has also cleared the way for Seminole County to enforce a ban that local commissioners adopted in the wake of violent crimes at these facilities. This ruling will likely embolden local governments throughout Florida to adopt similar measures.

The location at 231st and Cherry Street is near the light rail station and nearby shopping is within walking distance. However, for anyone who has to walk to ride a bicycle on 231st Avenue in either direction, there are no sidewalks, minimal bike pathways and just one pedestrian crossing. This is a problem for current Orenco area residents. We will only be placing more people at risk if the city of Hillsboro and the developer do not address these missing pedestrian and bicycle-friendly amenities."

"Two years ago, these two teams met in the Elite Eight in Houston. This time around it's Atlanta.

Rhimes had made her mark mining the drama in medical milieus (\"Grey's Anatomy,\"\"Off the Map\") but had been interested in D.C. power during college, when she spent a semester working at a Washington law firm.

Speed and distraction sometimes work to get the third kid's shoes on before the first one is standing there with naked feet and wiggling his toes. There are times you wish they could still just ride in the stroller, but then we wouldn't need this walk in the first place. Oh the paradox that is child rearing."

"Believe it or not, this has given me pause. What? A journalist with a conscience? (This was the semi-serious reaction I got from Judge Franz Miller last week as we commiserated on public-access issues in the Internet Age. Yes, Your Honor, there's also this moralist I've heard about at the Cleveland paper, and a thoughtful guy at a rag in the Tampa-St. Pete area, although he might have died. But, yeah, so far as this profession goes, we're about it.)"

"We need to get over the idea that \"fair\" is life's ultimate goal. If it were, we'd add up the total of government services and split the pie evenly. We don't. The rich pay more. Or, we'd go one step further and calculate what portion of government services each person uses, given school attendance, trips driving on the road, visits to parks, and on and on. Imagine the cost we would all incur for that accounting job."

I remember our director Joe Acenti, who just passed away in October, always said it was one of his favorite game broadcasts. The way he cut that show, it was like a movie.

"Part of the problem is the personnel around Sullinger. The Buckeyes, with guards Lenzelle Smith Jr. and Aaron Craft in the starting lineup, play three-on-five at the offensive end of the floor. Someone besides Craft has to get the ball to Sullinger, and the other two starters, William Buford and Deshaun Thomas, are responsible for the most ill-advised, itchy-trigger-fingered 3-pointers late in games of the season -- Buford at Indiana and Thomas against Wisconsin."

"As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall."

"Heuchera (coral bells), those low-growing shade garden plants with a multitude of leaf patterns and colors, are still the most interesting entries in the shade category. Breeders are coming up with new colors every day. Heuchera, close kin of Tiarella and Heucherella, are hardy little plants but deer have noticed them in my garden. Spray them as you protect hosta and day lilies. Heuchera send up a scape of tiny, mostly pink flowers in spring that sits well above the leaves. When flowers are done, look to the interesting leaves of 'Miracle' for a bright maroon color surrounded by a thin lime green margin, rather like an old Persian carpet. Other tempting varieties are 'Plum Royale' and 'Tiramisu', but gardeners should see these plants to decide which of the colors will enhance their particular gardens. Remember to play light and dark leaves against each other for interest. Gather a few in your shopping cart and wander around a garden center, making combinations for your beds and containers, designing on the hoof, you might say. And don't just buy one: remember to mass plants for better effect, especially when the plants themselves remain small, as coral bells usually do. Plant three of the same together, and add a plant with a different texture like a large fern or hosta for contrast of form and texture. In pots, only one of a kind may be needed to compose a pleasing look with other flowers and foliage."

"Doctors are faced with decreasing incomes and at the same time are beset by a huge proliferation in Medicare billing codes due to fee-for-service payments, and by increasing administrative quality requirements and insurance restrictions. Given the necessary legal responsibility and authority, doctors (not insurers) can define necessary care, which will cut excessive spending and end the fear of unfair, unrestrained use of health care. Doctors tend to resist this proposed responsibility, viewing it as the government again telling them what to do — but many are ready for change. And this would be different: It could work according to rules that would be set by doctors for doctors, doing what federal and insurance company administrators cannot do."
"Still, I'm not sure how I'll cope in the coming months. Will my heart race every time I hear a car stop outside the house, worrying that it has brought an Army casualty notification team?

Olive oil is, essentially, the juice of an olive, a stone fruit (there are 700 varieties). \"The fresher, the better,\" she says. Olivette's oils have been milled within three to four hours of harvesting. Sitting around brings out acidity in the olives."

The young girls in the crowd (and many of the young girls' parents) cheered footage of Bieber playing Xbox. They cheered a tape of Bieber the infant singing the ABC song. They cheered his anthropologically interesting attempt at breakdancing. Such devotion makes outsiders suspicious. But when Bieber tore into a song, he justified much of the hysteria. \"One Time,\" the closest thing he has to a club number, hit like a karate chop; \"One Less Lonely Girl\" burned with randy urgency missing in its studio version.

Best of all was the piano ballad \"Down to Earth,\" a four-minute classic-rock throwback that culminated in harmony guitar solos. No, honest!, it did."

"Mindfulness teachers give each beginner a single raisin. The student holds it near his or her lips but doesn't eat it. He gazes at it. He holds it to his ear and squeezes to hear its sound. This is done slowly, with a sense of calm. By the time the student eats the simple, single raisin, he is aware of the sensory urges it elicited. If a raisin can arouse all these sensations, so can all other external things. This awareness is the lesson."

And it led to a solution that was tone-deaf architecturally: After failing to reach any common ground with the Conservancy, the district directed Gonzalez Goodale, in designing a new high school building, to match as closely as possible the size and shape of the old hotel.

"* With a 3-1 series lead, the Blues obviously are doing many things well. But as coach Ken Hitchcock has said, they can play even better. That starts with the designated top line of David Backes, T.J. Oshie and David Perron. The three have combined for one goal so far (Backes in G2) and are minus 4 collectively.

"Has really improved his patience and overall feel between the tackles from a year ago as well. Does a much better job picking his way through traffic, setting up blocks and than accelerating through daylight, as opposed to simply trying out sprit and run over any defender in his path. Lacks elite top end speed and isn't a guy who can simply outpace angles at the second level. However, is still a big play threat because of his ability to make defenders miss and break tackles at the second level. Is much more agile/sudden than given credit for and will catch the football out of the backfield as well.

Though they potentially feature higher interest rates, they bring efficiencies and better allocation of risk that could drive down costs."

"Brandon Mobley (16 pts., 9 reb.): Played his best game of the season at the perfect time for Seton Hall, coming in early in the first half to boost a stagnant offense. It's no coincidence that when he was on the floor, Jordan Theodore, Herb Pope and Fuquan Edwin all had their best moments."

"Concerned about the disease among baby boomers, the CDC plans to issue a recommendation this year that everyone born between 1945 and 1965 be tested. Up until now, the federal agency only urged screening for those believed to be at risk. That strategy hasn't worked, in part because of the stigma - doctors don't ask about previous drug use and patients don't offer up the information. \"I certainly would not have come forward that I shot drugs,\" said Leslie Benson, 63, of Sacramento, Calif., who was diagnosed in 1992."

"Dallas regained the lead and the momentum at 82-81 on Terry's three just over two minutes in. It didn't last long, as the teams traded blows before Westbrook and Harden connected on back-to-back treys for a 92-88 lead. The Mavericks immediately got back within one on Nowitzki's conventional three- point play, and the two teams traded methodical possessions, before Carter's tough turnaround, after a 1-of-8 shooting start, gave Dallas a 97-96 lead."

"Artspace , which launched in April, offers a more populist approach to collecting. Yes, it sells boldface names like Gary Hume, Jenny Holzer and Chris Ofili, whose pieces garner figures well out of more modest budgets. But by leveraging an extensive network of partnerships with galleries, museums and foundations, Artspace is able to present exclusive limited editions—such as two photo-works by the London-based duo Gilbert & George, priced at $4,000 (with proceeds benefiting the Brooklyn Museum). And while Artspace's prices are hardly low, the chance to snag a sculpture by Kehinde Wiley for $1,400, or a print by art collective Assume Vivid Astro Focus for $250, is hard to dismiss. More art-by-the-yard enthusiasts can search by groupings, such as \"Gifts for the Home,\" and membership provides access to weeklong private sales."

"Gartenberg said HP's recent actions have proven that point. Earlier this month, the company said it was canceling its TouchPad tablet after having launched it in July. The company slashed prices to $99 from $500, and stores started selling out nationwide. The fact that little software was available for the tablet or that the company was not going to be improving the product didn't scare away shoppers."
"\"We've been faced with adversity all year,\" he said. \"I went out. Carmelo went out, Jeremy went out, Jared Jeffries went out, so we've been dealing with adversity all year.

"Netflix also predicted that it would make money during the current quarter."
"Even with the continued influence of special interests, Deal’s order has kept lobbyists’ gifts low compared with the freebies that flow to the Legislature.

"\"People in Oregon love the Ducks and Beavers, and they like that age group of athletes that aren't being paid and are trying to do the best they can with their skills to get to the next level,\" Piper said. \"When you look at all the players we have going to the NHL, people start to realize that this is a higher level of hockey than they may have once thought.\""

"La Catrina isn't your typical revolutionary babe, but her appearance has everything to do with the Mexican Revolution. Posada's working life paralleled the reign of dictator Porfirio Díaz, whose accomplishments in modernizing and bringing financial stability to Mexico pale against his government's repression, corruption, extravagance and obsession with all things European. Concentration of fantastic wealth in the hands of the privileged few brewed discontent in the hearts of the suffering many, leading to the 1910 rebellion that toppled Diaz in 1911 and became the Mexican Revolution."
"Durant finished fifth in the voting last season, when Chicago's Derrick Rose won it, and second in 2010."
"Did the rise of the 1 percent (or, better yet, the 0.01 percent) cause the Lesser Depression we're now living through? It probably contributed. But the more important point is that inequality is a major reason the economy is still so depressed and unemployment so high. For we have responded to the crisis with a mix of paralysis and confusion -- both of which have a lot to do with the distorting effects of great wealth on our society."

Gansler said Friday that he has not yet decided whether to participate."
"Eric Burdon, Jimmy Cliff, Win Butler and Regine Chassagne of Arcade Fire, Tom Morello, Joe Ely and Alejandro Escovedo helped Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band tear down the Moody Theatre on Thursday night. The sensational concert -- only the second by the new version of the band -- left last Friday's fine Apollo Theatre show in the dust. The rhythm section was tighter, the transitions were crisper, the harmonies were sweeter, and the long roster of surprise guests made the two and a half hour show feel like \"The Last Waltz.\""

This week the Supreme Court, which twice has upheld the constitutionality of some racial preferences in university admissions, agreed to hear a challenge to the University of Texas' use of race as one factor in a \"holistic\" admissions policy.

But since then O'Connor has been replaced by JusticeSamuel A. Alito Jr., who is regarded as more skeptical of racial preferences. Advocates of affirmative action fear that conservatives on the court are determined to overturn or gut the court's 2003 Michigan decision and the 1978 Bakke decision before it, which held that race could be considered as a \"plus\" factor in the admissions process so long as there were not fixed racial quotas."

"(Closing statement)- \"Let me conclude with this and then you've got more important things to do. This is not rocket science. They're not giant conspiracy theories. Those of you that have been at this a long time, it's kind of cut and dry. You need good players who are coached well, you need a little luck with injuries and you can get this thing done.

We have a good coach, we have a good coaching staff, we are getting better players, we've got young people that I think will be here a while. There's a good feeling in the locker room. The business side of it is going okay. I think the owner's feeling pretty good, which helps me. What I would ask is that is to kind of spread the word a little. I think distractions are created and some of them are unnecessary. They just are. It's not helping anything and I understand everyone has a job to do. I get all that. Some of it, the distraction causes us to be less than our best at times because you are dealing with young people, immature at times, and they kind of don't understand the big picture. People can write that I'm leaving town Monday. It doesn't bother me all that much. We joked about it today because I kind of get it. If you write that about our starting quarterback, 'What do you mean I didn't tell anybody that.' They don't get it. I know you want us to do well, I know everybody wants the team to come back to their former glory. You can help with the formula, I guess that's what I'm saying. I appreciate it. Thanks for your time today.\""

"Open any daily newspaper or listen to any newscast in the U.S. and your senses are pounded with the violence prevalent in every city and state. Our country is a laughing stock as our elected officials behave like spoiled adolescents for all the world to witness.

One application gives two hours protection, about as much as an insect repellant with a low concentration of the chemical DEET. Alpha-Keri and Skin-So-Soft also repel insects; these products are less effective, but easy on the skin. Another non-DEET choice is Bite Blocker: It's made with oils of geranium, soybean and coconut, and offers about an hour and a half of protection."

The mantra around town was that Winslow never dropped the ball, but Brady Quinn's only series of 2007 ended with a field goal, not a touchdown because of Winslow's drop. Quinn's fourth-and-short pass in the collapse against Denver went right through Winslow's hands, too. He had had a big game overall against the defenseless Broncos."

The Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund from which benefits are paid are funded by payroll taxes and interest paid on investments in securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. (Monies lost to the trust funds from the current payroll tax holiday have to be made up by payments from the general revenue of the United States government.)"
"While public K-12 schools are free and parents sometimes have a choice of where to send their child (including home schooling), education is one product families are required to consume. What's more, the people who work at these schools are in a position of authority over their customers. The grades that teachers hand to students can have an enormous impact on their future. That sure is different from the commercial world where the customers' collective satisfaction, in most cases, determines the success or failure of the business."

In addition to the many events going on during the week, students have also received the popular \"Drug use is life abuse\" wristbands."

When you are 24 years and talented, you do not abide by conventional wisdom. Especially when you look around the country and see 10, 15, 20 major league cities that would welcome you into the starting lineup the moment you arrived. That, as they say, is baseball. When the Phillies drafted Brown in the 20th round in 2006, they had not qualified for the postseason in 13 years. Their payroll was worth $10 million less than the contract Jonathan Papelbon signed this offseason to be the team's closer for the next 3 years. Now?"
"While Ting can preach about the need to reset and redefine San Francisco politics with passion, it isn't clear that the strategy is paying off. With 15 candidates, and 11 of them considered serious, Ting barely registers as a blip on most major polls of the field, despite already being twice elected to the assessor's office by city voters. He also lags behind his peers when it comes to fundraising."
"He has a large ruddy head and short dirty blond hair and a red beard; if McNaughton's TV series gets made, it wouldn't be hard to imagine a Seth Rogan-esque man playing him. He was born in Moscow. His parents immigrated here when he was 7.

Tables are close together, and it's impossible not to get lured into what's going on around you: listening to snippets of conversation among the girls in the corner about their weekend mating patterns, watching the remnants of the bridge club out for an early dinner or a young professional couple who probably don't feel like going home to cook."
"We'd do this all the time if we could, of course. The problem is that everyone has day jobs. And while you might think that these people would be the kind of folks who embalm corpses for a living or perform their duties at Hot Dog On A Stick with a little too much enthusiasm, the truth is much more interesting. One woman works at a local sperm bank. Two women work at local sex clinics; one a professional phlebotomist for HIV testing, the other gives results to HIV test recipients -- her job is to tell people if they are HIV positive or not. One of the guys has worked in HIV mental health for the city and county of San Francisco for many years. And me? I just write about sex, so I work the \"cute and unemployed\" angle as hard as a girl can, while listening appreciatively to sperm bank chat and debating our favorite presenters on adult baby lectures. Oh, and I can patch inflatable canines in five minutes flat."
"That goes for Chandler, too. When the Knicks signed him in the blurry hours after the lockout this summer, the consensus first reaction went something like this: Sigh. There goes Chris Paul."
"I have spent my life struggling for the rights of working class people and for health care. I grew up understanding first hand what it meant for families who did not get access to needed care. I lived in 21different places by the time I was 17, including in a couple of cars. I understand the connection between poverty and poor health care, the deeper meaning of what Native Americans have called \"hole in the body, hole in the spirit\". I struggled with Crohn's disease much of my adult life, to discover sixteen years ago a near-cure in alternative medicine and following a plant-based diet. I have learned with difficulty the benefits of taking charge personally of my own health care. On those few occasions when I have needed it, I have had access to the best allopathic practitioners. As a result I have received the blessings of vitality and high energy. Health and health care is personal for each one of us. As a former surgical technician I know that there are many people who dedicate their lives to helping others improve theirs. I also know their struggles with an insufficient health care system."

"That was how Ballpark Village was pitched when introduced to the region 10 years ago this month. Cardinals owners talked that the demand for office and residential space next to a new downtown ballpark was so great that the complex covering 10 acres could be built as early as 2006 to coincide with the opening of the new ballpark. But that deadline and scope of work quickly moved to July 2009, when the team said a first phase of the village would be open when the Cardinals hosted the All-Star Game."

It will take up to six months for the fledgling to take to the air, and more than a full year of tutelage at the wings of Esme and Gilbert before the chick is fully integrated into the park's flock."

In other words, adults are frequently deciding whether and what the children may eat, and it's not clear why the state needs to step in to micromanage such decisions. Los Angeles, by the way, already bans vendors near schools, but the ban has limited effect, according to the study, because it's seldom enforced. A new state law is unlikely to change that."

In interviews Wang has cited a meeting with the civil-rights lawyer Evan Wolfson as an inspiration for \"In the Family,\" and one might see the film as a cultural conservative plea to extend traditional marital values and legal rights to same-sex couples. And yet the film's ending does not reconstitute the traditional family as such but rather suggests a more expansive and even progressive idea of what \"family\" might mean. Scenes unfold in contemplative long takes and carefully framed, deep-focus compositions. The style is too dramatically focused and pictorially unfussy to be classified as art-house minimalism. It is also too deliberative to be mistaken for a Hollywood prestige picture."

The French-language “Dis-Moi Que Tu M’Aimes” is little more than a shout, a swirling Farfisa riff and a few well-timed halts by the rhythm section; somehow, it’s irresistible. “Pretty Girls” repeats its title over and over like a drawled mantra — it’s more hypnotic Velvet Underground than modern pop. “Let Me Go” is little more than a blurt, but it’s certainly an arresting one. Potvin keeps things punchy by getting in and out of her songs quickly — several tracks on “Play” barely break the two-minute mark. It’s all such fun that by the time she drops her languid cover of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” on you at the conclusion of the album, you’ll barely mind. Fans of Liz Phair’s early insouciance and Lucinda Williams’ occasional whimsy should search this out."
