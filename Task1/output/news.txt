In “Brave New World,” the state has suppressed all simple sports because they don’t require lots of expensive equipment to keep the economy humming. Instead, it relentlessly hypes complicated tech-y activities such as “electromagnetic golf.” A couple of generations ago, kids might have bought one baseball glove and one bat that would last for years. Today they instead spend hundreds of dollars on Xbox 360s and games that quickly become boring and demand to be replaced with upgraded versions."

"Smith is a reliable and orthodox conservative on taxes and spending, but more liberal on social issues. He voted with Democrats, for example, to break a filibuster blocking consideration of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that would require paying women wages equal to men for similar work.

"Actually, many San Francisco neighborhoods have built their reputations as places of unique, tight-knit cultures. Ours is a city that so identifies by neighborhood that it sometimes resembles Renaissance Italian city-states writ small. While the rest of the country happily paints us with a single broad brush, we excel in fine gradations of distinction. I recall a friend who lived in the Mission, who by then was no longer one of its hard-core bohemians (not a renter, not an artist, not poor and not even a lefty), ranting about \"those people\" in Noe Valley, an appellation that began a mere three blocks away from his home. Freud coined the term \"the narcissism of small differences\" to describe the human impulse to reserve our most virulent feelings for those who resemble us the most, but after nearly 20 years in San Francisco, I wonder if we don't have a special monopoly on this trait."

All he had to do was hit Johnson over the middle or WR Brad Smith in the right flat and the Bills are kicking a field goal for a 7-point lead instead of punting."

"Luck makes few mistakes and works constantly to improve. Tall and strong, he has the size to take a hit and is not afraid to stand in the pocket and make a throw with pass rushers bearing down on him. While lacking the exceptional athleticism of Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III, Luck is a deceptively mobile QB who rushed for 957 yards in his college career, and he can make throws and accurate reads while on the run. The scouting combine only confirmed his standing as the top player available in the draft. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.67 seconds - fourth among quarterbacks - and finished first in the broad jump (10 feet, 4 inches), third in the three-cone drill (6.80 seconds) and fifth in the 20-yard shuttle (4.28) at his position.

"RHP Poll Pick: This position is a test of fence-sitters everywhere. There is no wrong answer, and apparently there is no right answer. I went with Tom Seaver*. When I first made out my list of the greatest living players, Seaver was one of the first names removed. Fast-forward a few days of research and Seaver was back on the trusty yellow legal bad, listed behind the likes of Bob Gibson, Bob Feller, Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. The more I looked, the more support for Seaver I found. I eventually sided with an ESPN poll of his peers that named him the best, and the influence he had over the next wave of starting pitchers. Still, there's a number of ways to go here. If you go with peak years, you can side with Gibson, Seaver, or Feller, the oldest living Hall of Famer. If you go with longevity and total numbers, Ryan's you're guy. If you go with the dominant heft from an entire career, then hold your nose and pick Clemens. Greg Maddux deserves some attention. And that's why I leave it up to you to pick. Click away. Active candidates: None like these guys."

Only prostate cancer confined to the prostate can be reliably cured. The side effects of erectile dysfunction and loss of urinary control can be corrected. Restoration of normal function is possible. To minimize the risk of incontinence and erectile dysfunction, surgical techniques have been developed at Johns Hopkins to identify the erectile nerves and carefully preserve them. The likelihood of success is related to preexisting function and a patient's age, with younger age being an advantage. The majority of patients treated at Johns Hopkins recover continence and their baseline erectile function."

"So in the back half of the season, the Buckeyes actually need to run more than they did in the first half. The Illinois game, which saw the Buckeyes gain 211 yards on 51 carries, was actually the right idea.

"Why is spit so full of information? Saliva contains proteins, enzymes, hormones and DNA. That's why the cholesterol spit-test won't be the only one you'll see in the next few years. One of the most exciting saliva tests in development is a reliable screening for the inflammation marker called C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP can indicate heart disease — or an impending heart attack — and tracking changing levels can let doctors and patients check on how well cardio treatments are working. That can speed recovery after a heart attack or other cardiac problems. And eventually, many important health risk factors — including stress; exposure to harmful chemicals in the air, water or food; a person's history of infectious disease; and of course oral health — may be measured this way."

"Our beef with beef gets bigger every week: The triple threat of high saturated fat and iron levels, plus HAAs -- byproducts of cooking meat at high temps -- promotes many cancers, heart failure, impotence and memory dysfunction. PLUS, a new supersize study links eating red meat to a shortened lifespan. But the meat-processing industry itself has handed you another reason to steam some veggies and grill those portabella mushrooms. Ta-da! Pink slime. What is it? Semi-liquefied scrap meat or trimmings. To ensure this slurry -- which the industry calls lean, finely textured beef -- isn't loaded with nasty bacteria, it's treated with ammonium hydroxide (window cleaner). The spritz of gas is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration; the National Institute of Health has a webpage on ammonium hydroxide poisoning. Go figure. Pink slime was developed as an addition to pet food, but about 70 percent of ground beef sold in the U.S. had it mixed in. Luckily, the recent public outrage was enough to get most American grocery stores to stop that practice (at least temporarily). McDonald's, Burger King and Taco Bell have stopped using the filler, as have many public-school systems. So what's your next move?"

Mubarak was a despot who honored his predecessor's treaty with Israel and was a friendly anchor in an often hostile, unstable region.

"In one way only, but a significant way, Mr. Cera reminds me of Billie Holiday, who achieved subtle marvels within a severely limited vocal range. His voice is breathy, wistful and piping, yet plaintive and emotive. His abstracted demeanor suggests an emotional range that is narrower still, yet his inhibitions are translucent, rather than opaque; directly behind them, intelligence seethes and passion smolders. It's remarkable that such a singular young actor—he's only 21—should have found so many worthy vehicles (\"Superbad,\" \"Juno,\" \"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\") in such a short time, but he's done it again as Nick Twisp, the hero of \"Youth in Revolt,\" which was directed with impressive flair by Miguel Arteta and adapted by Gustin Nash from the novels by C.D.

"He also said he has not discussed any specific cases, including any Abbott vs. Burke school funding decisions."
"Phu Quoc, a triangle-shaped island just 30 miles long, is closer to Cambodia than to the Vietnamese mainland. Settled in the 17th century by Vietnamese and Chinese farmers and fishermen, it was occupied in 1869 by French colonialists who built rubber and coconut plantations. The island was so remote for so long that when Saigon fell to Communist troops in April 1975, Phu Quoc's 10,000 people hardly seemed to notice and went quietly about their daily business, catching squid and tending their pepper vines."

"Again: I loved \"The Avengers.\" Other than Christopher Nolan's \"Dark Knight\" films, which are in a league of their own, this is one of the most entertaining films of the genre since the advent of the Superhero Movie Renaissance. One of the joys of the film is its self-aware sense of humor, whether it's Tony Stark noting the theatrical nature of Thor's family squabbles or the Hulk pulling an Indiana Jones on a grandstanding villain."

"This is the big question, and most people think taking the lump sum is the smart move. That’s not always the case. First, spreading the payments out protects you from becoming the latest lottery winner who’s lost all their money. Don McNay, author of the book “Son of a Son of a Gambler: Winners, Losers and What to Do When You Win the Lottery,” says nine out of 10 winners go through their money in five years or less. “It’s too much, too fast,” he says. “Nobody is around them putting the brakes on the situation.”"

"Some will be uncomfortable with the idea of a \"living truth\" because it accepts flexibility according to time, place, and circumstance in a nasty world of change. But those who are observant have witnessed again and again that when absolutist offenders of ethics and the law get caught, their first line of defense is to argue they should be excused because of time, place or circumstance. They suddenly become poster board displays of situational ethics."
"All we can hope for out of this case now is for the courts to recognize the right of same-sex couples in California to marry, surely a good thing but little help to families here in Maryland. The state does not have a domestic partnership law equivalent to California's, and Maryland's highest court ruled several years ago that the existing ban on same-sex marriage was legal under the state constitution. That means the operative logic at work in the federal appeals court's decision would have no bearing here. No matter what the Supreme Court does, advocates will have to keep at the difficult work of securing votes in favor of marriage equality in the legislature."

It could lead you to an artist you might like."

But in the end, we got members of both parties to come together and make sure that you could keep more money in your paychecks each month. And you're keeping that extra $40 in every paycheck because we made sure that we didn't stunt the recovery. We made sure that families got the break that they need. And that means more security for your families. It also means a boost for our economy at a time when we've got to do everything we can to keep it growing. Because more money spent by more Americans means more businesses hiring more workers."

I think it helped keep me fresh and it provided me with a perspective I didn't have before. As I have moved up in my career, I think I have become more versatile and more useful to the Coast Guard because of the broadening I received during that assignment."

"The two-game homestand was unforgettable. The anticipation leading to the games, the crowd's roar when Jorge Perlaza scored Jeld-Wen's first MLS goal, all of it. It was magical. In the second game, the unthinkable repeated itself. After taking a commanding 3-0 lead against FC Dallas, the Timbers and its fans went into cruise control. When Dallas scored the second of two quick goals with 10 minutes left to play, I wondered how the crowd would respond. At first it was silent, a temporary moment of shock. Then the crowd -- all of it -- rose to its feet and got to business. The place went nuts, willing the Timbers to their second win. At that moment, I knew it. If I wasn't all in before, I am now."

"Hey, Tony: Last week, a reader posed a question as to whether Colt McCoy can be fairly assessed. You answered that he could, because a QB should be assessed by his individual skill-set -- \"his arm, his ability to function in the pocket, his ability to see the field and read defenses, his ability to anticipate routes and place the ball where it needs to be.\" Now, I have no idea if Colt McCoy is the answer, and frankly I do not think he is. But outside the arm element, it seems that every other aspect of your skill-set of your evaluation directly correlates to the QB's grasp of the offense. How well one knows the offense allows him to anticipate routes, helps him to know what to look for in a defense, and the inability to do either of those things results in someone looking skittish in the pocket. I believe you also said Drew Brees had a \"noodle-arm\" when he was still on the Chargers -- so, who knows? -- Sam Toth, Cleveland Heights"

"In the 1970s and '80s, grain processing began shifting overseas, where building codes and public health requirements were looser, and to U.S. factories that were easier for trucks to reach. The city bought the mill in 2000 for $7.7 million; the final owners left behind machinery, files, office equipment, old bills and more grain than you could eat in a lifetime. Much of that remains, ghostly, grainy hints of the days when American ingenuity ruled the world and Portland was known as an industrial hub rather than a cultural hotspot. It's no wonder Mayor Tom Potter and his City Council colleagues agreed to reconsider city plans for the mill in 2004, despite prescient warnings about the potential cost and logistical difficulties of any renovation. This is a branch of our history that we've almost lost entirely."

He wants what is best for his teenage son Dylan (Colin Ford) and 7-year-old daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), but particularly in the case of Dylan, he doesn't know how to provide it. Dylan is remote, spending his time drawing horrific pictures, and Benjamin struggles to reach him. He fares better with Rosie, but the family has been rocked by tragedy -- how could it not be?"

Delta said it was ending Detroit flights so it could start nonstop flights to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, but the service didn't click and was soon gone."

"Sprouted-grain breads may not have much of an edge over other whole-grain breads, but both are more healthful than white, refined-flour breads, Frechman says. In the 1990s and 2000s, several large-scale studies showed that people who ate more whole grains lowered their risk of coronary heart disease by 20% to 40%. White breads are often enriched with iron and B vitamins that are lost when the bran and germ are removed from the wheat kernel during processing. And processed white flour is usually fortified with folic acid, resulting in higher levels of the B vitamin in white bread. But only whole-grain products contain the complete array of antioxidants and phytonutrients -- as well as lots of fiber -- present in whole-wheat kernels."

Together they offer 300 acres ribboned with 73 trails - which is where I ski - including seven birch- and spruce-dotted glades (Moe's terrain) winding through Bear's woods.

"Danja brings the Bollywood while M.I.A. chants \"Live fast/ Die young/ Bad girls do it well\" like some kind of dysfunctional mantra. And that's just the chorus. The rest of the song puts the auto in autoerotica while hypnotizing listeners with the rapper's most seductive track in ages. There's steam on the window screen and wheels are bouncing like a trampoline as she promises, \"When I get to where I'm going, gonna have you trembling.\" It sounds like the score for an alternate ending to \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" with Jamal and Latika hooking up in an abandoned car instead of everybody dancing on that platform."

"3John Cleland's novel about a young woman's erotic adventures, first published 2½ centuries ago, was banned in Britain until the 1960s. Deservedly so, if you believe in obscenity laws. And the book certainly ignores the darker side of prostitution in 18th-century London. But as a candid study of human sexuality in its infinite variety, \"Fanny Hill\" can't be beaten. Fanny, who tells her story in a series of letters, begins as a virtuous young woman and ends up, through no fault of her own, in a London brothel that doubles as a hat shop. Her career, though lurid by any measure, is nevertheless recounted in prose that captures the rhythms of 18th-century spoken English as well as the riotous permissiveness of the age. She vows \"to paint situations as they actually arose to me in nature, careless of violating those laws of decency, that were never made for such unreserved intimacies as ours.\" This book will incense some readers, but Fanny's character is so human, and her attitude to her experiences so essentially sane (and, yes, pleasure-loving), that perhaps Cleland should be forgiven his effrontery in creating her."

"The agile frontman refused to let his hoarseness affect the rest of his performance. He charged around the stage, eyes popping, leaping in and out of the spotlight, gesturing to his bandmates with theatrical waves of his hands. His flute-playing was, as always, exuberant: he snorted, grunted, overblew, flutter-tongued, forced guttural noises out of his axe, executed runs at blinding speed, and alternated between wet, breathy, and mockingbird-sweet tones. He stalked the curved front of the PNC stage, piping as he went; from time to time, he sustained that famous stork-legged pose that is to Anderson what the moonwalk was to Michael Jackson."

It was a little more dense than conventional cake but still delicious. Many GF mixes require ingredients absent from most pantries, not this Bob's mix.

One-sixteenth of the unprepared mix (30 grams) has 110 calories, 0.5 grams of fat and 2 grams of fiber. We successfully made this cake substituting apple sauce for half the butter and separating the eggs so we could whip the whites to lighten the cake.

It just felt like Ray Charles understood how I felt, which was probably pretty delusional for a kid. But I found a lot of comfort in those records.\""

But once Taylor relaxed, his honeyed, conversational delivery was engrossing — “Fire and Rain,” for instance, retains its ability to hypnotize. As for King, a few missed notes didn’t stop her from singing to the rafters, again and again.

Reading Sontag's casual journal entries is the closest any of us will get to being inside her brain. And oh, what a brain it was! The subject of the diary is exactly what its ponderously Sontagian title indicates, \"consciousness harnessed to flesh.\" Sontag puts it more simply: \"There is no one right way to experience what I've written. I write - and talk - in order to find out what I think.\" Entries range from anguished heartache over love affairs to notes about books she was reading (or intended to), and fleeting observations about this and that thinker, artist, exemplar."

"It makes no sense, except in one place in the world, the place where it started, on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. And though they come down from that mountain and go about their lives, they keep going back to it, over the course of years, because however much the love doesn't make sense, it's real -- so real, it makes their lives unreal. There are kids, marriages, jobs, nights of drinking, heterosexual flings, in-laws and holidays to celebrate, and they do everything they're expected to do, but numb. Then every so often, they meet back up on the mountain and get to be themselves for a few stolen days. The situation carries a lot of emotional power, largely because it's so specific and yet undefined. The two guys -- cowboys -- are in love with each other, but we don't ever quite know if they're in love with each other because they're gay, or if they're gay because they're in love with each other."

"7. HONOR GUARD: The highest honor that a baseball person can achieve greeted Whitey Herzog in July, and the highest honor a civilian can receive was awarded Stan Musial this past month. Herzog, the Cardinals' beloved manager, was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame this past year. Musial will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February.

"Italians are famous for lingering over their exquisite meals, and Pietro Marcello lingers deliciously in this documentary as he establishes the lives and relationship of a serial jailbird named Enzo, who grew up on the tough streets of Genoa and has just been released from jail again.

"I’m betting that the news yesterday that Arizona State linebacker Vontaze Burfict tested positive for marijuana at the NFL Scouting Combine was treated with little more than a shrug in the Ravens’ draft room. I can’t say for sure that Burfict, who some draft pundits once considered a potential first-round target of the Ravens, is not on the team’s board. However, I can say that I would be very surprised if he was, even if we’re talking the sixth or seventh rounds here. I think the Ravens have enough confidence in their coaching staff and locker room leadership to take a chance on a player with some character concerns and discipline issues. But as they say, the tape doesn’t lie, and Burfict’s scouting tape this past season was, by all accounts, extremely poor. Throw in the interviews he bombed at the combine – and the Ravens conducted one of them – and I’d have to think that he was off the Ravens’ board long before his latest mishap."

"That's what makes this interesting to me. On the one hand there was a clear recklessness to what Kennedy did. And while this does tell us something of Kennedy's character, it shouldn't make us jump to the conclusion that he was incompetent as a president.

"The only question is how to balance the city's interest in keeping streets safe and clean with the U.S. Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures of property. The homeless often carry the things they own with them but sometimes must leave them briefly unattended while eating, bathing or meeting with social workers.

OSU coaches may initially use him at safety and on special teams. … Robinson runs the 100, 200, 4x100 and high jumps in track and wouldn’t mind participating on the Beavers’ track team if he’s allowed. … Scott on Robinson: “He’s got so much upside. He’s very fast, great change of direction with that ‘burst’ college coaches look for. We couldn’t get him the ball enough. He was one of the best (3A) players in the state on offense and was the best defensive player in 3A. … I think he was a steal. He got stolen out of the state of Oklahoma. A lot of coaches have sat in my office and said the same thing, that he’s the one that got away.’’ … Robinson visited the OSU campus last weekend, and solidified his commitment even though he was disappointed that Heyward had jumped to the Washington Huskies’ staff. “Of course it came as bad news, because he was the one who pushed me to (come to OSU),’’ said Robinson. “It was hard when he left.’’"

It would take six months and cost $65, the man told the young hunter, and that didn't seem right. When Yost looked into it, he learned he could stuff a pheasant himself for less than $2, finishing in a day. So he took up the trade, starting with ducks and other waterfowl, graduating eventually to deer and coyotes, mastering the art of caping and fleshing, tracing the eyes and lips, then stretching the flesh over a mold for the final stitching."

Why, for instance, should qualities as inane as shortness and vowels get to dictate something as ane as immortality? And why does \"inane\" get to be a real word while poor \"ane\" does not?

"Actually, Derrick Rose continues to be ESPN's No. 1 favorite for MVP (mine, too), with James at No. 2.

"It hasn’t been listed as an offseason priority, like bolstering the offensive line, finding another pass rusher and upgrading the receiving corps, but the Ravens would very much like to strengthen their special teams coverage teams.

"Andy Staples, SI.com: \"I hope football didn't do this. Did the game Junior Seau loved help take his life? We don't know. We don't know why one of the greatest linebackers of his generation shot himself in the chest Wednesday and died at 43, leaving behind four children. It's entirely possible his demons came from other external factors. Maybe they were always there. We don't know. But given everything we've learned in the past few years about the brain damage caused by repeated head trauma, the immediate reaction is to point the finger at football. That's the biggest problem the sport has right now. Not bounties. Not performance-enhancing drugs. It's the mounting evidence that repeated shots to the head could be slowly killing football players. Even if it had nothing to do with Seau's death, football has lost the benefit of the doubt. Every time a far-too-young ex-player dies after suffering some sort of mental distress, football will be the prime suspect.\""

"* Peggy's Work/Life Balance: We've already heard Peggy wonder if her commitment to work makes her seem more like a man than a woman, and her boyfriend, Abe, isn't helping her internal struggle any. As she gets up to go to work, he's still in bed, suggesting they go see the movie, \"The Naked Prey.\" But Peggy's obsessed with the Heinz presentation, since those bean counters are the clients from Hell. Abe is ticked off that she keeps focusing on work, and tells her to have a bleepy day. After all this, when Peggy does get to work, Don drops out of the presentation to take Megan upstate to a Howard Johnson's for a work-related trip, and when the Heinz guy doesn't like Peggy's pitch, her attempt at changing his mind through some sort of ninja thought domination results in her getting pulled from the account. She glugs down some whiskey, and goes to the movies, to see \"Born Free,\" and winds up sharing a joint with a stranger, who she then, er, gratifies there in the dark."

"The facts are these: No one has ever been fired or denied tenure (or \"expelled\" from school) for challenging Darwinism or for promoting \"intelligent design,\" or ID creationism. The details of each alleged case of persecution presented in the film can be found at the aforementioned websites, but take it from a former creationist (when I was an evangelical Christian) and current evolutionary theorist (I teach a course in the subject at Claremont Graduate University) that Darwinism always has been and continues to be challenged by scientists. In Charles Darwin's own time, of course, numerous books and articles were published critiquing his theory, and through the turn of the century there was still no underlying mechanism to explain how natural selection works and why so much skepticism remained.

"Problem is, it won't be well-received in the coming months. Many players came here because of Erickson's loose culture.

"He said his goal isn't a full-time move from sports to news, as Holliday did in 1989 and former Channel 5 sports director Mike Bush did eight years ago - and he remains the station's lead male anchor.

"But if you read these masterful profiles serially in \"Stories Done: Writings on the 1960s and Its Discontents,\" you take a densely informative trip that may also bring you down like a night flight landing in a rain storm. That's because so many of the pieces in the book were occasioned by the subject's death: Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsberg, George Harrison, Hunter Thompson, Garcia and Leary. All are eulogized here, summed up by one of pop culture's best writers, a man whose 1994 memoir \"Shot in the Heart,\" recounted his older brother Gary from an angle more personal than Norman Mailer's \"Executioner's Song.\" (It won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was adapted into an HBO movie.)"
"Media, wearing required credentials, had to enter the Mo Center through a corner door on the opposite the side of the building as the double doors.

"Of course I view investment in startup public transit as the solution to both of these dilemmas. But start up public transit requires a 50 percent pony up from the state, as opposed to roads, which only require 20 percent ( the feds pay the other 80 percent). The latter infamous legislation was the result of the first budget of George W. Bush in 2001 and therefore it is entirely improper to blame President Obama or even Gov. Martin O'Malley, who inherited this outrageous double standard."

"The IPNC is a pricey event, running nearly $1,000 a person, a great deal in any economy -- and especially the current one -- but there's a spirit of dedicated nonchalance because the opportunity to sample a flow of great and often rare wines is so unusual.

"Kaminski: But to be fair, Sarkozy has been saying a lot of the same things, too. He ran as a very sort of centrist, market reformer. And he's sort of lost his way. And I'm not sure--I think Hollande may dabble with some of this stuff early on and may end up getting a visit from his minister of finance and/or central bank governor, saying, \"You can't do this.\" And in a way, you know, France needs a change, and Sarkozy's been a disappointment in so many ways."

Although there are four selections from free black leader Frederick Douglass, there are no selections from slaves.

That, along with reduced investment spending, will help improve the U.S.'s underlying savings/investment imbalance. It will also cause a period of sluggish growth (perhaps outright recession), but that will have the effect of reducing the expected returns on dollar assets, finally driving the value of the dollar down in a serious way. That in turn will help make exports more competitive and imports more expensive, facilitating the badly-needed improvement in the U.S. trade balance. This doesn't have to be a disastrous series of events. But as I mentioned above, there is a real possibility that a significant dollar decline could turn into a rout, which could turn this slightly depressing but relatively benign scenario into a financial crisis."

Jackson would instantly become the lone Browns' talent that would cause an opposing defense anxiety, while Amendola could benefit from the continual underneath dump offs that are a staple of Shurmur's offense. Additionally, both players have Cleveland ties. Jackson was drafted by a front office that included Heckert and Amendola was formerly coached by Shurmur."

"problem in the short term is where to play everyone. Miguel Cabrera is an indifferent first baseman, but is probably a better option there than Fielder. Delmon Young shouldn't be allowed to play the outfield, and even if he was, the Tigers might prefer to play Ryan Raburn and Brennan Boesch in the corners since Young walks about twice a month.

Playing Fielder at first and Cabrera at third would be defensive self-immolation. The best solution might be to have Fielder and Cabrera share time at first base to keep both bats in the lineup as often as possible, since the risk of knee problems for, um, ‘husky' players is probably tied not just to age but to time standing at a position.\""

"Oh sure, I understand our financial crisis and the supposed fiduciary responsibility of the council but just how far do we, the electorate, allow this to go? I guess President Obama could say that the financial crisis is still overwhelming and suspend any upcoming vote for office. After all, the cost of an election is expensive and the considerable amount of time and money spent on running for office could be considered a waste. Consider what could have been done with the $80 million that Meg Whitman spent just on running for office. Now add in the money spent on all the other elections. In truth, President Bush could have used the same reasoning, but I am glad he did not. I believe that is the way that dictators or \"Presidents for life\" do it.

"Mark Kriegel, FoxSports.com: \"Say what you want about Calipari: his two vacated Final Fours (one at UMass, another at Memphis), his quest for an NBA paycheck, and his aptitude for exploiting the rules (other coaches only wish they could do it that well). But if you value the highest level of basketball, if you value teamwork and selfless play, then recognize this team for what it is. Or was. Six players are soon expected to declare for the NBA. Three of them are freshmen, two sophomores. They're not mature, certainly not by age and experience. But Calipari got them to play wise beyond their years. Stakes are high. Egos are fragile. And college-age kids shouldn't be expected not to be knuckleheads. Still, none of these student-athletes (a phrase the NCAA uses without shame or irony) ever played as if he were auditioning for the NBA. That's an accomplishment. That's coaching. You may not like Calipari. But the coaching he's done this season is worthy of great respect.\""
